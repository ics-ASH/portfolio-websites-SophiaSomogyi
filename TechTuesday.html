    <h3>Raspberry Pis</h3>
    <p>Raspberry Pis were created in the UK in 2012. Though computers are widely used devices, in many developing countries they are difficult to 
        access, and this is where the raspberry pie comes in. They are a low costing single computer board around the size of a credit card, 
        created to be widely accessible while still being affordable and useful. Raspberry Pis are mini-computers that are able to exchange and 
        process information from multiple different devices.  They are often used to learn programming or for data management. A raspberry pie has 
         features similarto a motherboard while taking out things that are not necessary. such as its internal storage. To using raspberry pi requires
         an SD card containing an operating system, that is needed for the computer to work. Raspberry Pis are compatible with the 
         Linux OS, which reduces the amount of storage required. 
    <p>Raspberry Pis have many features that make them popular and easy to use. These include: CPU, HDMI and USB ports, GPU, Memory, an 
        Ethernet port, an SD card, and GPIO pins. The CPU or Central Processing Unit acts as the main base of operations for the Raspberry pi and 
        performes actions using logical and mathematical operations. An HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface) port is useful because it
         gives options for video output, and it has a USB port for connecting to other devices. The GPU or Graphic Processing Unit helps the
          Raspberry Pi make quicker calculations. Its memory stores real-time information to be easily referred to later. It has an 
          Ethernet port for wired internet access. A Secure Digital (SD) card is used instead as a storage device and is necessary for it to function, 
          as it contains the operating system that turns it on and is used to store data. GPIO pins are General Purpose Input and Output pins that 
          can be used to interact with other electronic circuits and can be programmed to read and control electronic signals from other boards. 
          Finally, it uses different color LEDs to show different things, like if it is powered on or to monitor Ethernet connection.
