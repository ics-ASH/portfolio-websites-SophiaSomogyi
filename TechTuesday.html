    <h3>Dark Web Target: IoT</h3>
    <img src="https://cdn.builtin.com/cdn-cgi/image/f=auto,fit=cover,w=1200,h=635,q=80/https://builtin.com/sites/www.builtin.com/files/2022-08/connected-devices-internet-of-things-iot-devices.png" >
    <p>The dark web is a marketplace where unlawful activities occur while being anonymous. IOT - the internet of things-  is deeply connected to the internet and therefore vulnerable, it has become a target for cybercriminals and those who work through the dark web. One weak device can cause an entire network to be breached. The consequences of a breached device are large and have big repercussions such as a ransom fee, fines, and loss of reputation. 
 
    </p>
    <p>IOT devices are a great entry point for cybercriminals because they are a single point of vulnerability that allows them to attack multiple people at the same time. In the last 3 years, researchers have found a large increase in cyber attacks in IOT devices across the world, Europe having experienced the most attacks at around 70 per week per organization. Each successful attack on an IOT device costs over $330,000.

    </p>
    <p>Combining AI and IoT has resulted in an increase in web-originated attacks to levels never seen before. These attacks include automated exploitation, where AI scans for vulnerabilities and security flaws and creates an attack without any human involvement, adaptive attacks, where AI helps attackers by analyzing defenses and helping them adapt, behavioral analysis, where AI analysis IoT devices and how they are used to find patterns that hackers can use, and adversarial attacks, which can be used to trick AI models and IoT devices so they will make bad decisions and leave themselves open to attacks. This is why it is so important for IoT devices to have security measures put in place to protect their data.

    <h3>Gel Palm Robot</h3>
    <img src="https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__image_gallery/public/images/202405/MIT-GelPalm.png?itok=hqJ618Er" >
    <p>Computers and robots have been developing at a rapid rate but developers have been struggling with recreating the human grasp. Recently there has been a big development by MIT that has completely changed the way robotic hands were created. This hand is called GelPalm. It uses advanced spencers for more sensitive movements, helping the robot handle objects more delicately and more precisely. The hand also has finger bones called ROMEO (Robotic Modular Endoskeleton Optical) and uses flexible materials and similar sensory technology to act as the palm. The team that created it added something called “passive control”, which means a robot can adjust to pressure and weight naturally without the need of extra motors or added control.  
    </p>
    <p>The Gel Palm has safe interactions with objects which will help greatly in human-robot interactions, with prosthetics and the overall function of robots. They were inspired by human hands with their rigid bones and soft tissue.By combining rigid objects with soft and compliant materials they act more similarly to human hands, conforming around objects just like our hands do. The palm was tested on different illumination systems, blue LEDs and white LEDs, which were a part of the robot’s fingers. They were able to make 3D reconstructions when pressing objects into the gel surfaces. Liu and her team also tested how the palm could grab different types of objects, making it difficult by coating some in paint. 
    </p>
    <p>One difficulty they encountered was being able to include enough sensory technology in the palm while keeping it at a good size and flexibility, because the sensors are camera based, and the technology for them is not yet as advanced as it would need to be.The hope is that in the future this technology will be useful for developing more complex robotic hands with similar capabilities to human hands, a very difficult task.

    <h3>Blockchains</h3>
    <img style='height:200px;width:290px;float:left;'src="https://contenthub-static.crypto.com/wp_media/2023/05/WHAT_IS-BLOCKCHAIN_OTP.jpg" >

    <p>Blockchains are databases shared by multiple computer networks. They are made up of multiple unchangeable blocks, linked together by something 
      called cryptography - a way to secure data from hackers. Blockchains are similar and different to spreadsheets and typical databases. They are 
      similar because they are all used to enter and store data, and different because of how the data is structured and accessed. Blockchains collect 
      transaction information and enter it into a block. It is then encrypted by creating a hexadecimal number called the hash. Next, the hash is entered 
      into another block and encrypted, which creates a series of blocks. New blocks get stored by adding them to the end of the blockchain, and it 
      prevents previous blocks from being altered. 
    </p>
    <p>There are many pros and cons to block chains. First let's talk about the pros. One pro is removing a third party, because you no longer have a 
      third person verifying transactions there are less fees for transferring money. It can help keep personal information secure in unstable and 
      underdeveloped governments and because it would not be controlled by one big group it makes it harder to tamper with.it also has a higher accuracy 
      in verification because human involvement is removed. There are also plenty of cons. When using blockchains there are serious data storage limitations 
      and the regulation varies from place to place. There is also a lot of history of people using them for illicit activities such as on the dark web and 
      because the technology needed for block chains are extremely expensive.

    <h3>Black Box</h3>
    <img style='height:200px;width:275px;'src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1630853010132-68f3aea24257?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxzZWFyY2h8Mnx8YmxhY2slMjBjdWJlfGVufDB8fDB8fHww&w=1000&q=80" >

    <p>An AI black box is an AI system with software that is invisible to the user. A user can give an input and receive an output, but cannot see the 
      internal workings of the system's code or logic. AI uses something called machine learning, which uses algorithms, training data and a model. It 
      learns how to identify patterns after being trained with an extensive set of examples. Once the algorithm has been trained, the result is a machine 
      learning model. This model is what is used for AI programs such as Chat GPT and DALL-E2. For example, these programs would be able to identify 
      patterns, like finding a specific object in an image. You would feed the algorithm images and get an output on whether they have that object or not. 
      In a black box any of the components that make up machine learning can be hidden, but in many cases the algorithm is already known, defeating the 
      purpose of having the black box. So in many cases the training data would be put into the black box to stop others from seeing the information.
     </p>

    <p>Black boxes may appear to be a good idea, however they can result in more harm than good. These algorithms are not transparent with users and 
      there is no way for people to know the machine’s reasoning behind the decisions it makes. This could cause issues for cases like asking an AI to 
      give a medical diagnosis, because it would be unable to give a reason for its decision. The reason black boxes were created was to stop hackers 
      from accessing the code, but this had been revealed to not completely work because of the option of reverse engineering software. In conclusion, 
      black boxes are not all that helpful when it comes to AI programs that impact people.

    <h3>Motherboard</h3>
    <img style="border-style:None;float:left;" src="https://www.ieiworld.com/_attach_file/product/photo/854_1641446764_IMBA-Q470-ATX-motherboard-side-w600.png" >

    <p>A motherboard is a piece of internal hardware. It distributes electricity and controls communication between the CPU and RAM. There are many types
       of motherboards that are each compatible with specific computers depending on the size, processors, and memory whereas they can all work with a 
       variety of hard drives. On the earlier versions of motherboards there were fewer components, they usually had a CPU and card ports, but users had 
       to add things like memory and controllers for floppy drives like on the first IBM PC motherboard. 
    </p>

    <p>When a computer is used, electricity gets transferred to the motherboard. Data is then moved between the chipset components and travels between 
      the southbridge and northbridge sections, which interact with other parts of the computer such as CPU, RAM, PCI and PCIe through electrical signals 
      that pass through a microchip to either bridge. The information sent will be encoded through binary and translated in a split second. 
      The northbridge helps data connections to the RAM, operations from the RAM are interpreted by the CPU and acts as the output after the RAM delivers 
      the inputs. After information is sent to the PCIe, the data is copied or moved to an expansion card, depending on the card being used. The 
      southbridge controls data connection to the BIOS, USB and the SATA. Your computer turns on because of the signals going to the BIOS and the data 
      going to the SATA, which turns on your optical, hard disc and solid state drives. The information saved on the SATA gives power to many things such 
      as the video card, sound card and the network card. Motherboards allow the different aspects of the computer to communicate, and are an essential 
      part of making the computer work.

    <h3>Raspberry Pi</h3>
    <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1358/0*IiQMM0O2XENasVbb" >
    <p>Raspberry Pis were created in 2012 in the UK. Though computers are widely used devices, in many developing countries they are hard to access, 
      which is where the raspberry pie comes in. They are a low costing single computer board around the size of a credit card. They were created to be 
      widely accessible while still being affordable and useful. Raspberry Pi’s are mini-computers that are able to exchange and process information from 
      multiple different devices. They are often used to learn programming or for data management. A Raspberry Pi has similar features to a motherboard 
      while taking out things that are not necessary, such as its internal storage. To use a Raspberry Pi you will need an SD card containing an operating 
      system, which is needed for the computer to work. Raspberry Pis are compatible with the Linux OS which reduces the amount of storage required. After 
      setting up the OS to the Raspberry Pi, you can connect the Raspberry Pi to a monitor, HDMIs, television, mouse, or keyboard as an output device. 
     </p>
    <p>Raspberry Pis have many features that make them a popular and very versatile tool. These include: CPU, HDMI and USB ports, GPU, Memory, an Ethernet 
      port, an SD card, and GPIO pins. The CPU (Central Processing Unit) acts as the main base of operations for the Raspberry Pi and is used to perform 
      actions using logical and mathematical operations. An HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface) is useful because it gives options for video output,
       and it has a USB port for connecting to other devices. The GPU (Graphic Processing Unit) helps the Raspberry Pi to make quicker calculations. It has
        memory that stores real-time information to be easily referred back to later. It has an Ethernet port for wired internet access. An SD (secure 
        digital) card is used instead as a storage device and is necessary for the Raspberry Pi to function, as it contains the operating system that turns
         it on and stores data. GPIO (General Purpose Input and Output) pins can be used to interact with other electronic circuits and can be programmed 
         to read and control electronic signals from other boards. Finally, it has LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) with different colors to show different 
         things, like if it is powered on or to monitor Ethernet connection.
