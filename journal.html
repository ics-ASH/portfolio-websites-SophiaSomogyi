  <!-- Week 1 -->
<section>
    <h2>Week 1</h2>
    <p>This week we learned what this course will be about, and what the semester will look like. We watched the movie <i>Hidden Figures</i> for a few classes and had an interesting presentation from someone from Nokia, where she talked about how she got her job and the tech industry engineering in general. 
    </p>

<!-- Week 2 -->
<section>
  <h2>Week 2</h2>
  <p>This week we started setup for the rest of the semester. We signed up for multiple websites that will be used throughout the course, like Typing Club, CMU, W3schools, and put our login information into a google doc. We also downloaded some software for our websites: Github Desktop and Visual Studio Code. VS code will be where we type our code, and Github is where we save it and push it to the repository. 
  </p>

<!-- Week 3 -->
<section>
  <h2>Week 3</h2>
  <p>This week we did our first Tech Tuesday. Rory and I read an article about Raspberry Pi’s and wrote a summary about it. I thought it was really interesting how they were made to be cheap and accessible ways to practice coding, and all the different parts it contained. On Wednesday we had our first CSE class, though it was mostly just setup. For the last few days, we started learning about Binary using the website Khan Academy.
</p>

<!-- Week 4 -->
<section>
  <h2>Week 4</h2>
  <p>This week we continued learning binary from Khan Academy. We did lessons on converting binary numbers to decimal numbers and later had a lesson in class where we practiced adding and subtracting binary numbers on the whiteboard. Our Tech Tuesday topic was hardware, and we did an article on Motherboards – a key component of computers that allows the different parts to communicate. We ended the week with a quiz on binary. 
  </p>

<!-- Week 5 -->
<section>
  <h2>Week 5</h2>
  <p>This week we started doing coding in CMU by going through the lessons in Unit 1. We learned how CMU uses the python programming language, and how to create shape. For example, drawing a rectangle with Rect() and giving it x and y coordinates, and a height and width value. We also did a final creative task for the unit. Mine was of six flowers in a vase on a windowsill. On Wednesday our CSE class was a basic introduction to python, where we learned about integers, variables, strings, floats, and Booleans.

<!-- Week 6 -->

  <h2>Week 6</h2>
  <p>March Break! </p>
</section>
<br>

<!-- Week 7 -->
<section>
  <h2>Week 7</h2>
  <p>This week we started with a class to work on our websites. I used W3schools to learn about HTML and CSS, and how to create a links bar and basic layout for my pages. We did another Tech Tuesday, with the topic of artificial intelligence. Rory and I did ours on Black Boxes, which are AI systems with software that is invisible to the user and are meant to stop hackers from accessing code. At the end of the week, we worked on an ai project.

    <!-- Week 8 -->
    <section>
      <h2>Week 8</h2>
      <p>This week we worked with a new website called Code HS and went through lessons on AI. We learned about strong and weak AI, and self-driving cars and the benefits and risks of that technology.

    <!-- Week 9 -->
    <section>
      <h2>Week 9</h2>
      <p>This week we worked more on Code HS and our final project for our AI unit. Mine was about the possibility of AI Superintelligence, which is the idea that AI in the future might become too powerful and get out of control.
