          <h2>Week 1</h2>
          <p>This week we learned what this course will be about, and what the semester will look like. We watched the movie <i>Hidden Figures</i> for a few 
            classes and had an interesting presentation from someone from Nokia, where she talked about how she got her job and the tech industry engineering 
            in general.

          <h2>Week 2</h2>
          <p>This week we started setup for the rest of the semester. We signed up for multiple websites that will be used throughout the course, like 
            Typing Club, CMU, W3schools, and put our login information into a google doc. We also downloaded some software for our websites: Github Desktop 
            and Visual Studio Code. VS code will be where we type our code, and Github is where we save it and push it to the repository.

          <h2>Week 3</h2>
          <p>This week we did our first Tech Tuesday. Rory and I read an article about Raspberry Pi’s and wrote a summary about it. I thought it was really 
            interesting how they were made to be cheap and accessible ways to practice coding, and all the different parts it contained. On Wednesday we 
            had our first CSE class, though it was mostly just setup. For the last few days, we started learning about Binary using the website Khan Academy.

          <h2>Week 4</h2>
          <p>This week we continued learning binary from Khan Academy. We did lessons on converting binary numbers to decimal numbers and later had a 
            lesson in class where we practiced adding and subtracting binary numbers on the whiteboard. Our Tech Tuesday topic was hardware, and we did an 
            article on Motherboards – a key component of computers that allows the different parts to communicate. We ended the week with a quiz on binary.

          <h2>Week 5</h2>
          <p>This week we started doing coding in CMU by going through the lessons in Unit 1. We learned how CMU uses the python programming language, and 
            how to create shape. For example, drawing a rectangle with Rect() and giving it x and y coordinates, and a height and width value. We also did 
            a final creative task for the unit. Mine was of six <a class="six" href = 'Projects.html'> flowers in a vase</a> on a windowsill. On Wednesday our 
            CSE class was a basic introduction to python, where we learned about integers, variables, strings, floats, and Booleans.

        <h2>Week 7</h2>
        <p>This week we started with a class to work on our websites. I used W3schools to learn about HTML and CSS, and how to create a links bar and basic 
          layout for my pages. We did another Tech Tuesday, with the topic of artificial intelligence. Rory and I did ours on Black Boxes, which are AI systems 
          with software that is invisible to the user and are meant to stop hackers from accessing code. At the end of the week, we worked on an ai project.

        <h2>Week 8</h2>
        <p>This week we worked with a new website called Code HS and went through lessons on AI. We learned about strong and weak AI, and self-driving 
          cars and the benefits and risks of that technology.

        <p>This week we worked more on Code HS and our final project for our AI unit. Mine was about the possibility of AI Superintelligence, 
          which is the idea that AI in the future might become too powerful and get out of control.

          <p>This week we worked on CMU Unit 2, which taught about ways to make projects move. There were lessons about functions and mouse press 
            events, like onMousePress and onMouseRelease. On Wednesday we got to try some things with the Raspberry Pis on our own, and worked 
            through the beginner challenges. Rory and I got dots to appear on screen, and used FOR loops to make rows and columns.

          computers rather than monitors. During CSE on Wednesday, we started the intermediate challenges, which included making an oscillating 
          dot and column.

            a different color polaroid depending on where the user clicks on the canvas. On Wednesday, we finished the CSE intermediate challenges, and 
            made fire truck and police car lights by alternating red and blue lights in different ways.

        <p>This week we focused on hardware. On Monday, we took apart and reassembled a PC, and learned about the different components like the fan, 
          power supply, wires, and motherboard. Then we had a group project where we made a poster about a hardware topic. Rory, Izzy, and I did ours 
          on peripherals, which are devices that are added on to a computer, like a monitor or mouse. On Wednesday, Rory and I worked on our Raspberry Pi 
          and the advanced challenges. We made the entire Pi change to a certain color based on the user’s input. On Friday we started our building a 
          computer project, where we had to create a plan for a setup and choose hardware, software, an operating system, networking, and maintenance.

          <p>This week we started working on our K8 robot. My group built it and put all the pieces together on Tuesday. On Wednesday we did CSE, and Rory 
            and I moved our files around and put them into folders for beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Then on Thursday we started learning how to use 
            MakeCode, coding K8 to do things using block coding. I was absent Friday.

        <p>This week we continued working on K8. On Wednesday for CSE we all got individual Raspberry Pis, and got to use the examples and change them to make 
          our own projects. I used the example of the beating heart and made it into a sun. For the rest of the week we continued working on K8, and on Friday 
          we made a <a class="six" href = 'Projects.html'> Poster</a>.

            CMU and figured out more of the advanced challenges. I made a rainbow on the unicorn hat using hsv colors. On Friday we decorated the walls of the 
            ring for the K8 battle.

          helped Mr. J fix up his classroom a bit. Rory and I fixed the lights on the ceiling. On Thursday we worked on our websites, and on Friday we started 
          Unit 3 of CMU.

          <h2>Week 18</h2>
          <p>We spent most of this week working on Code HS and learning about Artificial Intelligence. I did lessons on different types of AI (generative and predictive), 
            people who create AI, and how AI is being used, like in robots and video games. Also how to best make prompts for AI. We finished the week by working on an 
            AI project. My group and I made a Scratch game called<a class="six" href = 'Projects.html'> AI Detectives</a> that teaches about how AI is used in everyday life, 
            like in facial recognition.

          spent the rest of the time doing lessons on Code HS. We continued Code HS on Thursday, and did gardening on Friday.
